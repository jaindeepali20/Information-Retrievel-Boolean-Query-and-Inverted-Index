# Information-Retrievel-Boolean-Query-and-Inverted-Index
In this project, we were be given a sample input text file consisting of Doc IDs and sentences. Based on this provided input text file, our task was to build our own inverted index using the information extracted from the given data. Our index should be stored as a Linked List in memory as the examples shown in textbook. Having built this index, now you are required to implement a Document-at-a-time (DAAT) strategy to return Boolean query results. Finally, we are required to calculate a TF_IDF score to rank and sort the query results. Our implementation is purely based on Python3 only.
